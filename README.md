### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ¤– I am a research scientist at [Ford Greenfield Labs](https://corporate.ford.com/operations/locations/silicon-valley.html), working on autonomous vehicles perception. I love building neural networks ðŸ§  and solving problems such as 3D scene understanding, end-to-end robotics learning for vision and autonomous driving.
